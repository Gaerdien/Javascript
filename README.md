# Javascript
Javascript projects to train and study based on numerous methods to write code.
This Javascript repository is made so I can share my evolution online and maybe help others with simple projects to learn the bases of JS.
I do intend on creating other repositories for each language I start to learn and improve, but for now, this is my starting point.

Hoping this can help others too, sharing my experience through comments in my code and projects ideas for everyone. Every code I post will not have any type of AI writing, just raw and maybe not the
best form of code possible, and I do promisse I'll give my best.
